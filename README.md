# Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Using Different RNN Techniques

This repository provides a complete end-to-end project for sentiment analysis using RNNs. It covers all steps, from data preprocessing and model training to saving and reusing the trained model for real-time predictions.

## Project Highlights

- **IMDB Dataset Handling**: Load, preprocess, and tokenize data.  
- **Token Indexing**: Save word indexes for consistent tokenization during predictions.  
- **RNN Model Creation**:  
  - Without embedding  
  - With embedding  
- **Model Saving and Reuse**: Save trained models and use them for real-time predictions.  
- **Tokenizer for Predictions**: Convert input text into token indexes for model inference.
